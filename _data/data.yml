career-profile:
  title: Personal Statement
  summary: |
    I am a self-employed full stack web developer with a focus on Node.js, React, and Gatsby. I have OpenJS certifications for both Node.js Application and Node.js Services development.

    I previously worked as a Chinese-English localisation specialist in Beijing but have transitioned to a self-taught web developer in recent years, resulting in development of my own Node.js web framework called Tuft. I am open to starting a new career in back end or full stack web development in New Zealand.

    Already confident in my skills with Node.js, TypeScript, React, REST APIs, testing frameworks such as Jest and Cypress, databases, and cloud services such as AWS and Azure, but always looking for new opportunities to gain professional work experience.
