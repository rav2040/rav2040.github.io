career-profile:
  title: Personal Statement
  summary: |
    I am an OpenJS certified Node.js Application and Services developer.

    I previously worked as an English teacher and Chinese-English translator/localization specialist in Beijing, but have recently transitioned to a self-taught Node.js developer, and am now looking to start a new career in back end or full stack web development in New Zealand. Already confident in my skills with Node.js, HTTP web servers, React.js, databases, and cloud services such as AWS and Azure, but looking for new opportunities to gain professional work experience.
